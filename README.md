# What is it?

This page is the first project for Turing MOD 1 students.

# What is the objective?

This is a project designed for students to practice improving their basic HTML and CSS skills. The goals are as follows:

1. Practice building a static web page.
* A comp was provided, which the end product design should accurately represent.

2. Increase skills in HTML.
* Focus on writing properly structured HTML according to the Turing HTML Style Guide.

3. Increase skills in CSS.
* Focus on having DRY CSS using the Turing CSS Style Guide.

4. Incorporation of JavaScript if possible.
* Begin experimenting with JavaScript extensions.

# How it was made

Created with a combination of HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript

# Coding Style

Standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

# Challenges

Making the page responsive was the biggest challenge.
Also I had trouble getting the background photo to cover the entire section in one piece, instead I kept getting multiple sections blocked off.

# Extensions

Created a function with JavaScript to change the name of SOME DOGS to whatever is put into the name input box.

function changeName(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  dogName.innerText = dogInput.value
  dogInput.value = "";
}

 # UPDATE
 
 I made a commit with changes to the CSS, however I mislabeled the commit message. It says "Update html" but it actually is updated CSS.
